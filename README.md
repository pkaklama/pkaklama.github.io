<p><b>Abstract:</b>		  We consider a non-dimensionalised version of the four-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley equations [J. Rubin and M. Wechselberger, Giant squid-hidden canard: the 3D geometry of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, Biological Cybernetics, 97 (2007), pp. 5-32], and we present a novel and global three-dimensional reduction that is based on geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT). We investigate the dynamics of the resulting reduced system in two parameter regimes in which the flow evolves on three distinct timescales. Specifically, we demonstrate that the system exhibits bifurcations of oscillatory dynamics and complex mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), in accordance with the geometric mechanisms introduced in [P. Kaklamanos, N. Popović, and K. U. Kristiansen, Bifurcations of mixed-mode oscillations in three-timescale systems: An extended prototypical example, Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, 32 (2022), p. 013108], and we classify the various firing patterns in dependence of the external applied current. While such patterns have been documented in [S. Doi, S. Nabetani, and S. Kumagai, Complex nonlinear dynamics of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations induced by time scale changes, Biological Cybernetics, 85 (2001), pp. 51-64] for the multi-timescale Hodgkin-Huxley equations, we elucidate the geometry that underlies the transitions between them, which had not been previously emphasised.  parameter. </p></details><br>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>		We study a class of multi-parameter three-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations that exhibit dynamics on three distinct timescales. We apply geometric singular perturbation theory to explore the dependence of the geometry of these systems on their parameters, with a focus on mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) and their bifurcations. In particular, we uncover a novel geometric mechanism that encodes the transition from MMOs with single epochs of small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs) to those with double-epoch SAOs. We identify a relatively simple prototypical three-timescale system that realises our mechanism, featuring a one-dimensional S-shaped supercritical manifold that is embedded into a two-dimensional S-shaped critical manifold in a symmetric fashion. We show that the Koper model from chemical kinetics is merely a particular realisation of that prototypical system for a specific choice of parameters; in particular, we explain the robust occurrence of mixed-mode dynamics with double epochs of SAOs therein. Finally, we argue that our geometric mechanism can elucidate the mixed-mode dynamics of more complicated systems with a similar underlying geometry, such as of a three-dimensional, three-timescale reduction of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations from mathematical neuroscience.</p></details><br>

Syst., 18(3), 1225–1264 </i> (2019); <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/18M1214470" target="_blank">SIADS link</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09810" target="_blank">arXiv preprint</a></summary>
<p><b>Abstract:</b>	In this work, we study the dynamics of piecewise smooth systems on a codimension-2 transverse intersection of two codimension-1 discontinuity sets. The Filippov convention can be extended to such intersections, but this approach does not provide a unique sliding vector and, as opposed to the classical sliding vector-field on codimension-1 discontinuity manifolds, there is no agreed notion of stability in the codimension-2 context. In this paper, we perform a regularization of the piecewise smooth system, introducing two regularization functions and a small perturbation parameter. Then, based on singular perturbation theory, we define sliding and stability of sliding through a critical manifold of the singularly perturbed, regularized system. We show that this notion of sliding vector-field coincides with the Filippov one. The regularized system gives a parameterized surface (the canopy) independent of the regularization functions. This surface serves as our natural basis to derive new and simple geometric criteria on the existence, multiplicity and stability of the sliding flow, depending only on the smooth vector fields around the intersection. Interestingly, we are able to show that if there exist two sliding vector-fields then one is a saddle and the other is of focus/node/center type. This means that there is at most one stable sliding vector-field. We then investigate the effect of the choice of the regularization functions, and, using a blowup approach, we demonstrate the mechanisms through which sliding behavior can appear or disappear on the intersection and describe what consequences this has on the dynamics on the adjacent codimension-1 discontinuity sets. Finally, we show the existence of canard explosions of regularizations of PWS systems in ℝ<sup>3</sup> that depend on a single unfolding parameter.</p></details>

<details><summary><b>Recent advances in mathematical modelling in neuroscience Minisymposium</b> (<a href="https://ecmtb2022.org/" target = "blank">12th European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology</a>, 19-23 September 2022)</summary>
<p>Dynamical systems have long been an important tool to model and understand biological phenomena, for instance in relation to neuronal, cardiac, and other physiological processes. In this framework,
finding a sound balance between model complexity, biological plausibility and computational efficiency
is a challenge of utmost importance, in order to not only advance our knowledge in the field, but also
to address contemporary problems and needs in the corresponding fields of high medical and societal
importance. In this mini-symposium, we present four recent works in the broad field of mathematical
neuroscience; namely, each speaker presents their contribution in the advancement of one of the following
topics: synaptic transmission; complex multi-timescale oscillations of membrane potentials; firing dynam-
ics in pyramidal neurons and interneurons; and attractors and waves in networks of integrate-and-fire
neurons. During the talks, the variety of tools and the methodologies which have been used to reach the
novel analytical results on the aforementioned models will be discussed, with emphasis on open questions
that emerged during this process and their relations to the behaviour of the corresponding biological
systems.</p></details><br>

<p>The Edinburgh SIAM-IMA student chapter hosted a week-long student study group with industry supported by the Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Sciences, the Edinburgh Mathematical Society (EMS), the Glasgow Mathematical Journal Trust (GMJT), the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), and the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA). 

The event offered:

1.       An opportunity for graduate students to apply mathematics in an industrial setting,

2.       A chance for collaboration with students from different institutions and from a wide range of research areas, and

3.       Essential skills training in communication and presentation skills.

This event was based on the format used for the established modelling camps and study groups, and offered an opportunity to work on real life industrial problems. </p></details><br>
